A wide range of medical and health care services is available through the Medicaid program. These services are covered only if they are medically necessary. Medicaid recipients have free choice of a doctor, dentist, pharmacy, and other providers of services. However, in many counties, some people covered by Medicaid are required to get certain medical services through a managed health care provider (either a health maintenance organization (HMO) or a MediPass doctor). These people have the opportunity to select a provider, however, if they do not select one they will be assigned to a provider. A provider that chooses to participate in the Medicaid program must accept the payments that Medicaid makes and make no additional charges to the recipient for services covered under the program. However, some services covered by Medicaid do require a small co-payment be paid.",Some services covered by Medicaid do require a small co-payment be paid.,"Medicaid is available to certain, low income people. You must be one of the following to get Medicaid. These are called eligibility groups.

To get help from most Medicaid programs, you must: Be a U.S. citizen or a legal qualified alien.  As of July 1, 2006, anyone who gets or applies for Medicaid needs to show proof of citizenship and identity.  In most cases, if you were born in the United States you are a U.S. citizen.
